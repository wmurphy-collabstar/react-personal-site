            <p>
                I am currently a Client Support Developer at IBM Quantum but am an aspiring Front End Developer. I live in the Westchester NY area, and have a black cat named Raven. I graduated from Wesleyan University two years ago and have been working at IBM since. After finishing this course and career path at Scrimba, I hope to become a useful Front End Developer helping the world in whatever way I can.
