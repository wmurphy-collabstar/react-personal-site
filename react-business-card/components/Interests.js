            <h3>Interests</h3>
            <p>I'm very interested in web design and the behind the scenes work into putting a website together. I'm also interested in solutions that help in the health care, security, and workforce specifically. I also love to watch Kdramas, play with my cat Raven, and learn coding through Scrimba.</p>
